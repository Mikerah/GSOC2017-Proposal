    <h2>Abstract</h1>
    <p>For GSoC, I plan to work on automating backlisting and adding more documentation to the Ahmia project's web pages. 
       First, I will work my way through the codebase to learn how the search engine works. After this, I will add documentation to the project's
       github page by creating a wiki for new developers. Next, I will create support pages on the Ahmia search engine for advanced search features
       and for general help navigating the search engine. Next, I will start researching features of websites we want to blacklist such as content, malware,etc. My initial
       idea is to use a probabilistic approach. My other goals for the project include anonymously collecting data and safely storing such data.</p>

    <h2>Why Tor?</h2>
    <p>
    Since my elementary school days, I have had a strong interest in all things technology. 
    This includes security and artificial intelligence. In the 6th grade, I wanted to become a hacker.
    Thus, I read upon all the things hackers used and all the knowledge they have to gain in order to be 
    successful hackers. This period is how I discovered the Tor project and in particular the Tor browser.
    It was slow and I was ignorant about its significance. Since then, the Tor project has come such a 
    long way and I have seen it become more and more on people's radar. 
    Ever since Edward Snowden disclosed the NSA surveillance, I began using the Tor browser more regularly
    and developed a deeper interest in security. I realized that I was taking for granted how open and 
    free the Internet is and why need organizations like the Tor project and EFF to defend what makes the 
    Internet probably the most important human achievement in recent history.

    <h2>Experiences with free software development</h2>
    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    During the summer, I plan to take evening courses for my degree and I will have a once a week part time job on the weekend. Other than this, I will be able to work on GSOC.

The way summer courses work at my university is that there is 2 semesters: the first from May to June and the second from July to August. The exam period for the first semester is from June 26 to 30 and for the second is from August 15 to 18. The exact dates of my exams are not posted yet. When I get them, I will inform my mentor.

    </p>
    <h2>After GSoC 2017</h2>
    <p>
    My project will require maintenance and in order to keep up with the tactics that websites with inappropriate content come up with, I will need to stay up to speed with how to improve the algorithm for backlisting. As for the wiki and support pages, I will update accordingly whenever I get feedback about them.
    </p>
    <h2>Other GSoC Projects?</h2>
    <p>Nope!</p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    I believe that my mathematics background will be of great benefit to developing algorithm for automating backlisting. My statistics background will enable to write user friendly support pages. I self-taught myself programming when I was 13 and I would love to contribute to Tor even if I'm not accepted to GSOC this year. I strongly believe that having a user friendly search engine on the Tor network will bring more user of Tor.
