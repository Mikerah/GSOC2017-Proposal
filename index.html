    <h1>GSOC 2017 Proposal for Tor Project: Ahmia Search Engine</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h1>
    <p>For GSoC, I plan to work on automating backlisting and adding more documentation to the Ahmia project's web pages. 
       First, I will work my way through the codebase to learn how the search engine works. After this, I will add documentation to the project's
       github page by creating a wiki for new developers. Next, I will create support pages on the Ahmia search engine for advanced search features
       and for general help navigating the search engine. Next, I will start researching features of websites we want to blacklist such as content, malware,etc. My initial
       idea is to use a probabilistic approach. My other goals for the project include anonymously collecting data and adding a query language for advanced searching options.</p>
    
    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement a probabilistic algorithm to identify the most likely webpages that may have child abuse content.</li>
        <li>Implement an algorithm that blacklists these potential child abuse websites</li>
        <li>Review the Ahmia Project's code base</li>
        <li>Write a guide for new developers in the Ahmia project's wiki</li>
        <li>Add more documentation to aid more experience developers</li>
        <li>Implement a query language for advanced search in Ahmia (Optional)</li>
        <li>Develop ways to anonymously collect user data (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>As we all know, a lot of the times our plans don't always work out. So these are the potential bottlenecks that I may encounter during GSoC</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automating Backlisting is taking me a lot of time to implement correctly</li>

            <h3>Steps to alleviate the situation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult Juha Nurmi</li>
                <li>Read research papers on search engines and the tor network</li>
                <li>Send an e-mail to the mailing list for some help and the way I approached the problem</li>
                <li>Add more time to this task</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps to alleviate the situation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult Juha</li>
                <li>Take time out of other tasks to dedicate to refactoring and documentation</li>
                <li>After GSoC, spend time improving the quality of the code</li>

    <h2>Code Samples</h2>
    <p>I have written a few web applications with Django that can be seen on my github page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/1Chan">1chan</a>:My attempt at building a textboard forum. It is currently in progress but it is a better representation of my skills building Django based web applications</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/FakeDataGenerator">FakeDataGenerator</a>: A web app that generates random and fake datasets. I believe that this is also a better representation of my knowledge of Django.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/WorldOfYoutube-WebApp">WorldOfYoutube</a>: A web app that let's users find popular youtube videos in countries around the world. This was my first Django based web application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Tor?</h2>
    <p>
    Since my elementary school days, I have had a strong interest in all things technology. 
    This includes security and artificial intelligence. In the 6th grade, I wanted to become a hacker.
    Thus, I read upon all the things hackers used and all the knowledge they have to gain in order to be 
    successful hackers. During this period is how I discovered the Tor project and in particular the Tor browser.
    It was slow and I was ignorant about its significance. Since then, the Tor project has come such a 
    long way and I have seen it become more and more on people's radar. 
    Ever since Edward Snowden disclosed the NSA surveillance, I began using the Tor browser more regularly
    and developed a deeper interest in security. I realized that I was taking for granted how open and 
    free the Internet is and why need organizations like the Tor project and EFF to defend what makes the 
    Internet probably the most important human achievement in recent history. 
    </p>
    <h2>Experiences with free software development</h2>
    <p> I have not contributed to free solftware developement before. However, I have tried to start such a project called 
        <a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/WikiSummary">WikiSummary</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    During the summer, I plan to take evening courses for my degree and I will have a once a week part time job on the weekend. Other than this, I will be able to work on GSOC.

The way summer courses work at my university is that there is 2 semesters: the first from May to June and the second from July to August. The exam period for the first semester is from June 26 to 30 and for the second is from August 15 to 18. The exact dates of my exams have not been posted yet. When I get them, I will inform my mentor.

    </p>
    <h2>GSoC Experience and Other applications</h2>
    <p>I do not have any previous GSoC experiences. I am also not applying to any other organizations.</p>
    <h2>After GSoC 2017</h2>
    <p>
    My project will require maintenance and in order to keep up with the tactics that websites with inappropriate content come up with, I will need to stay up to speed with how to improve the algorithm for backlisting. As for the wiki and support pages, I will update accordingly whenever I get feedback about them.
    </p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
   <p>I strongly believe that a user firendly search engine on the Tor network would encourage more people to use Tor. So, I would like to contribute to projects make Tor more accessible to the lay person. Moreover, I believe that mentorship is very important and that GSoC is a great initiative to bringing more people like to work on open source projects.</p>
