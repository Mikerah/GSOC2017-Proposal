    <h2>Abstract</h1>
    <p>For GSoC, I plan to work on automating backlisting and adding more documentation to the Ahmia project's web pages. 
       First, I will work my way through the codebase to learn how the search engine works. After this, I will add documentation to the project's
       github page by creating a wiki for new developers. Next, I will create support pages on the Ahmia search engine for advanced search features
       and for general help navigating the search engine. Next, I will start researching features of websites we want to blacklist such as content, malware,etc. My initial
       idea is to use a probabilistic approach. My other goals for the project include anonymously collecting data and safely storing such data.</p>
