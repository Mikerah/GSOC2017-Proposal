    <h1>GSOC 2017 Proposal for Tor Project: Ahmia Search Engine</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h1>
    <p>For GSoC, I plan to work on automating backlisting and adding more documentation to the Ahmia project's web pages. 
       First, I will work my way through the codebase to learn how the search engine works. After this, I will add documentation to the project's
       github page by creating a wiki for new developers. Next, I will create support pages for the search engine to help the usage of Ahmia. Afterwords, I will
       develop an algorithm for blacklisting child abuse websites by search for sites that link to these types of websites. In order to make Ahmia more user friendly,
       I will be developing advanced search options, similar to the way Google's advanced search options work. My optional goals for the summer are to develop ways to anonymously
       collect user data, improving the current statistics page and ways to gather anonymous feedback directly from users.
   </p>
   
   <p>The blacklisting algorithm will take advantage of the fact that linking to child abuse websites is a grey area, in other words, it is not illegal.The algorithm will acquire
      links to websites that link to child abuse websites, and ban the the links to the child abuse websites.
      
      Since search for particular websites due to the way Tor websites work, I think that having advanced search options will make it easier to browse websites on the Tor network.
      I propose the following search options:
      <ul>
        <li>The use of double quotes("") to search for a particular string and it is case sensitive. Example: "Politics" search term should only present websites that have a header/description with the word Politics</li>
        <li>The use of the operator OR between search terms. Exmaple: term1 OR term2 should only present websites that contain either term1 or term2 or both term1 and term2 (like a logical OR)</li>
        <li>The use of the oprator AND between search terms. Example: term1 AND term2 should only present websites that contain both term1 and term2.</li>
        <li>The use of a dash(-) to before a search term. Example: -term1 should only present websites that don't contain term1.</li>
      </ul>
      As we get more user feedback, more search options will be added.
   </p>

    <h2>Code Samples</h2>
    <p>I have written a few web applications with Django that can be seen on my github page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/1Chan">1chan</a>:My attempt at building a textboard forum. It is currently in progress but it is a better representation of my skills building Django based web applications</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/FakeDataGenerator">FakeDataGenerator</a>: A web app that generates random and fake datasets. I believe that this is also a better representation of my knowledge of Django.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/WorldOfYoutube-WebApp">WorldOfYoutube</a>: A web app that let's users find popular youtube videos in countries around the world. This was my first Django based web application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Tor?</h2>
    <p>
    Since my elementary school days, I have had a strong interest in all things technology. 
    This includes security and artificial intelligence. In the 6th grade, I wanted to become a hacker.
    Thus, I read upon all the things hackers used and all the knowledge they have to gain in order to be 
    successful hackers. During this period is how I discovered the Tor project and in particular the Tor browser.
    It was slow and I was ignorant about its significance. Since then, the Tor project has come such a 
    long way and I have seen it become more and more on people's radar. 
    Ever since Edward Snowden disclosed the NSA surveillance, I began using the Tor browser more regularly
    and developed a deeper interest in security. I realized that I was taking for granted how open and 
    free the Internet is and why need organizations like the Tor project and EFF to defend what makes the 
    Internet probably the most important human achievement in recent history.
    </p>
    <h2>Experiences with free software development</h2>
    <p> I have not contributed to free solftware developement before. However, I have tried to start such a project called 
        <a href="https://github.com/Mikerah/WikiSummary">WikiSummary</a>. My lack of experience in developping FOSS is the main reason why I decided to apply to Google Summer of Code.
    </p>
    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    During the summer, I plan to take evening courses for my degree and I will have a once a week part time job on the weekend. Other than this, I will be able to work on GSOC.
    The way summer courses work at my university is that there is 2 semesters: the first from May to June and the second from July to August. The exam period for the first semester is from June 26 to 30 and for the second is from August 15 to 18. The exact dates of my exams have not been posted yet. When I get them, I will inform my mentor.

    </p>
    <h2>GSoC Experience and Other applications</h2>
    <p>I do not have any previous GSoC experiences. I am also not applying to any other organizations.</p>
    <h2>After GSoC 2017</h2>
    <p>
    My project will require maintenance and in order to keep up with the tactics that websites with inappropriate content come up with, I will need to stay up to speed with how to improve the algorithm for backlisting. As for the wiki and support pages, I will update accordingly whenever I get feedback about them.
    I will also continue working on how we can anonymously gather data and report these numbers in a an approachable way. I am also considering becoming a mentor for GSoC 2018 if the Tor Project gets accepted again to participate.
    </p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
   <p>
    I would like to thank Juha Nurmi for helping with this application and for helping develop my ideas in accordance with the Ahmia Search Engine's goals.
    I strongly believe that a user firendly search engine on the Tor network would encourage more people to use Tor. So, I would like to contribute to projects make Tor more accessible to the lay person. Moreover, I believe that mentorship is very important and that GSoC is a great initiative to bringing more people like to work on open source projects.
